This is a small project created while follow along with "How to Create A Video Chat App with WebRTC" video on YouTube.

Here we'll be learning how to build a video chat web app which I may use in later project. This document list the step-by-step approach for this solution.
Once completed the web app will allow users to call one or more users, display a window for each user in a given calling session, and assign each user a 
Unique User ID (UUID). It'll also automatically create the rooms used for a given calling session.


<--Getting Started-->
- For starters make sure node.js and npm are both installed
- A Text Editor or IDE such as VS Code, VIM, etc

<-- Steps -->
1.) - Using the CLI type "npm init -y" will get our server boiler template JSON file generated titled "Package.json". 

2.) Next we need to install our dependencies using CLI
    type: " npm i express ejs socket.io"
        -Express is our server
        -EJS is our templating language
        -Websocket.io is used to allow us to communicate back and forth with the server 

3.) Now we need to install a dependency that allows us to create dynamic URLs (basically chatroom numbers).
    type : "npm i uuid"

4.) Now we install a dev dependency that allows us to quickly refresh our application every time we make changes so we don't have to manually restart 
    our server every time a change happens.
        type: "npm i --save-dev nodemon"

5.) Create a server.js file for our server configuration.

6.) Got to the "package.json" file and under "scripts" create the following to point to our "server.js" server configuration file.
    type the following key:value statement: ' "devStart" : "nodemon server.js" '
